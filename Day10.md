<h2>Classes and Prototypes</h2>

- An enormously popular paradigm for structuring our complex code.
- Prototype chain - the feature behind-the-scenes that enables emulation of OOP but is a compelling tool in itself.
- Understanding the difference between _proto_ and prototype.
- The new and class keywords as tools to automate our object & method creation.


## Core of development (and running code):

1- Save data (e.g. in a quiz game the scores of userl and user2).

2- Run code (functions) using that data (e.g. increase user 2's score).

## That is, I want my code to be:

1- Easy to reason about.

2- Easy to add features to (new functionality).

3- Nevertheless efficient and performant.

The Object-oriented paradigm aims is to let us achieve these three goals
