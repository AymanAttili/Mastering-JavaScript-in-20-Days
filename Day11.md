<h1>Types</h1>

- **In javaScript, not everything is an object, But they can behave as an objects.**

<h2>Primitive types:</h2>

- undefined.
- string.
- number.
- boolean.
- object. including arrays and functions.
- symbol.

### In javaScript variables don't have types, but values have.

```javascript
var v;
typeof v;  // here we are asking what is the type of the value in v
```
